# Breast_Cancer_Diagnosis_and_Prediction_by_Machine_Learning

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model to determine whether a breast cancer is benign or malignant.We will create a model that can categorize a breast cancer tumor using two types of training classification:1= Malignant (Cancer) - Present 0= Benign (non-cancerous) -Not present

Determine whether breast cancer is benign or malignant using information extracted from a digitized image of the fine-needle aspiration test (FNA) of a breast mass. Signs of breast cancer are lumps, breast shape changes, skin peeling, and redness. About 255,000 and 2,300 are diagnosed in women and men respectively. The disease accounts for 1 in 3 new female cancers annually. 

In conclusion, for our dataset, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model produced the best results. We experiment with feature selection utilizing a correlation matrix and feature importance to increase performance. Overall, we provided four machine learning models that may be used to increase the accuracy of breast cancer diagnosis and hence help with early detection.Logistic regression, random forest, SVM, and KNN to illustrate the reliable results obtained precisely and find the higher accuracy. Support Vector Machine achieved a higher efficiency of 97.2% precision of 97.5% with an AUC of 96.6%.

Using machine learning to detect cancer can help to reduce the dependence on the pathologist which is more useful in regions where pathologists are not available. The severity of the disease can be reduced if detected and diagnosed early with the help of machine learning technique
